Checkers-

The game begins when the player makes the first move.
The player can do this by clicking their game piece, the game piece and optional spaces to move to will be highlighted. The game pieces will only be allowed to move forward to another dark square. Every game piece can move one space at a time. After a game piece is moved, the turn ends, and the next player takes a turn.
The player may choose another game piece, or move their selected game piece to one of the selected space by clicking on the game piece or space.
The player’s goal is to eliminate all of the opponent’s game pieces. The player must “jump” over the opponent’s game pieces to an open space.
Once a game piece reaches the furthest row away from the player or opponent, that game piece will be crowned “king” and be able to move more freely. The King game piece is allowed to move forwards and backwards by one space.
Once all game pieces from either the player or the opponent are removed from the game board, the game ends, and a winner message is displayed saying the winner of the game. 
The reset button resets the game board back to the starting point.
